FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:

  (child-bad) begin
  load: pintos: open failed
  child-bad: exit(-1)
  (wait-killed) wait(exec()) = -1
  (wait-killed) end
  wait-killed: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
- (wait-killed) begin
- (child-bad) begin
- load: pintos: open failed
- child-bad: exit(-1)
- (wait-killed) wait(exec()) = -1
- (wait-killed) end
